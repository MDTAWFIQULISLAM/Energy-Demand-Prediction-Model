# Energy Demand Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting energy demand at a national level using advanced machine learning models. The project evaluates multiple algorithms—CatBoost, FB Prophet, and Neural Prophet—for their accuracy and adaptability in forecasting energy consumption, focusing on the Tetouan city dataset.

## Project Overview

This project explores the limitations of traditional energy forecasting models and demonstrates the potential of machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy. Key components include data preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation across three different machine learning algorithms.

### Key Features
- **Models Used**: CatBoost, FB Prophet, Neural Prophet
- **Data**: Tetouan city power consumption dataset (publicly available on Kaggle)
- **Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains raw and preprocessed Tetouan energy consumption data.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Models**: Scripts and configurations for each machine learning model.
